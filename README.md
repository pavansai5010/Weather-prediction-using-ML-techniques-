# Weather-prediction-using-ML-techniques-
Weather prediction using Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) like Linear Regression involves analyzing historical weather data to model relationships between variables such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. The model then predicts future weather conditions based on these patterns.
The dataset i had used for this project is downloaded from this website "(https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/)". It is an open source so you can modify the dataset according to your model.
